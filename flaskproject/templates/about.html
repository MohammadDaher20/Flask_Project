        A blog post is an article, guide, or news piece that is published on a
        website with the intent to cover a certain topic or answer a specific query.
        Blog posts are usually posted in "blogs", which are websites dedicated to publishing
        these types of content (usually focused on a certain topic or niche), but just about
        any website can have a dedicated blog section where these types of posts are produced.
